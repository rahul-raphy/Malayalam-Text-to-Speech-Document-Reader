# Malayalam-Text-to-Speech-Document-Reader
This is a text-to-speech python program for reading Malayalam stories using gTTS speech synthesis engine which can be accessed through the gTTS module in Python.

To create a text-to-speech program for reading Malayalam books in Python, you would need to use a speech synthesis engine that supports the Malayalam language. One such engine is Google's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, which can be accessed through the gTTS module in Python.

To use gTTS, you would need to first convert the text of the book into a string and then pass it as input to the gTTS function. The output of the function will be an audio file containing the synthesized speech.

To play the audio file, you can use the playsound module in Python. First, you would need to initialize playsound and load the audio file. Then, you can use the playsound("file name ") function to play the audio.

Overall, the program would involve three main steps: converting the text to speech using gTTS, saving the audio file, and playing the audio using playsound.

NB: During executing the program, you need to make sure that you have a stable internet connection
